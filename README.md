# onceUponAtimeInPornVille

A project for fine-tuning a SDXL model as a NSFW model. The goal is to be able to create images with natural language.

## I need your help

I am looking for detailed expertice when it comes to the following areas:

- what are the optimal way of preparing a dataset of images, how should the captioning be structured and such
- what are the optimal configuration for how to train the SDXL model with nude images

If you have experience or know how to do this please get in touch with me so we can talk.

A collaboration here will of course mean that you get access to the resources that I have at my disposal, so it is not intended that I will get free help, I am just trying to avoid wasting unnecessary time on the training set-up and computerized preparations. Put another way, I'm not willing to try to figure this out on my own, I remember what the end of visa was on SD1.5 after countless trial and error attempts, so here I have to have help otherwise it's impossible to continue.
